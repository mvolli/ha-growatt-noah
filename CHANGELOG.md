## [2.1.0] - 2024-12-XX

### üöÄ Major Refactoring
- **Raspberry Pi Optimization**: Reduced codebase by 67% for better performance
- **Noah 2000 Focus**: Removed unused Neo 800 inverter support
- **API-Only Connection**: Streamlined to only support Growatt Cloud API
- **Dependencies Minimized**: Only requires `aiohttp` (was 4 dependencies, now 1)

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Features
- **Energy Dashboard Ready**: Added battery energy sensors for HA energy dashboard
- **Sensor Naming Convention**: All sensors now use `sensor.noah2000.{name}` format
- **Real-time Data**: Direct Noah API integration with actual battery data
- **Working Battery Energy**: Power-based integration for charge/discharge energy tracking

### üîã Battery Energy Sensors
- `sensor.noah2000.battery_charge_power` - Real charging power from Noah API
- `sensor.noah2000.battery_discharge_power` - Real discharging power from Noah API
- Integration sensors for daily energy totals via Home Assistant helpers

### üßπ Code Cleanup
- Removed all MQTT functionality (unused for Noah 2000)
- Removed all Modbus functionality (unused for Noah 2000) 
- Removed Neo 800 inverter support (user only has Noah 2000)
- Removed test functions and development code
- Streamlined data models and API calls

### üìö Documentation Updates
- Updated README to focus exclusively on Noah 2000
- Added complete energy dashboard setup guide
- Included all sensor names and configuration examples
- Removed references to unsupported connection methods

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
